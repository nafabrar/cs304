What the project accomplished
=============================

We created a working application that supports several kinds of queries and updates on a schema that is very close to
what we planned in our initial requirements. In many ways it's similar to what a working business would need.

We did not end up supporting all of the actions described in our requirements, because we had to add actions that were not
in our requirements to satisfy what we were asked to do for the demo. We hadn't really planned on doing a division operation,
for example, so the one that we implemented was a somewhat contrived example (but it is correct).

We had to do a lot of work to work around the limitations of SQL

Schema differences
==================
Our schema didn't change all that much.

We discovered that SQLPlus is very error-prone when using dates as primary keys so we added an integer as an integer primary
key to the MembershipDate table.

Because there's no particular data type for time of day in SQLPlus, we encoded class start and end times as timestamps. This made
an additional day of week field irrelevant, since timestamps can encode that information.

We did not change any functional dependencies from our plan, so our original discussion of them from part 2 still applies.
